It is known that for every rational <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma <</symbol>>\\\\in (0,1)$<</equation>>, on one hand,  there exists sequences with randomness rate <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>>  that can not  be effectively transformed into a sequence with randomness rate higher than <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and, on the other hand, any two independent sequences with randomness rate <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>> can be transformed into a sequence with randomness rate higher than <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. We show that the latter result holds even if the two input sequences have linear dependency (which, informally speaking, means that all prefixes of length <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> of the two sequences have in common a constant fraction of their information).  The similar problem is studied for finite strings. It is shown that from any two strings with sufficiently large Kolmogorov complexity and sufficiently small dependence, one can effectively construct a string that is random even conditioned by any one of the input strings.\\n\\\\end{abstract}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\maketitle\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\section{Introduction}\\n\\nThe randomness rate of an object is the ratio between the information in the object and its length. An informal principle states that no reasonable transformation can guarantee an increase of the randomness rate. The principle has different instantiations depending on the meaning of ``object\\'\\', ``information,\\'\\' and ``reasonable transformation.\\'\\' For example, if <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is a mapping of the set of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings to the set of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>m<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings, then there is a distribution <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> on the set of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings with Shannon entropy <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<<symbol>><</symbol>>/<</symbol>>2$<</equation>> (\\\\ie,  the randomness rate of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is <<equation>>$1<<symbol>>/<</symbol>>2$<</equation>>) and the Shannon entropy of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> is <<equation>>$\\\\leq <<symbol>>m<<symbol>><</symbol>>/<</symbol>>2$<</equation>> (\\\\ie, the randomness rate of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> is <<equation>>$\\\\leq 1<<symbol>>/<</symbol>>2$<</equation>>). Thus no transformation <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> guarantees that its output has a randomness rate higher than that of its input. The case of infinite binary sequences (in short, sequences) is very interesting and has been recently the subject of intensive research. We say that a sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> has randomness rate at least <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>> if <<equation>>$K(x \\\\rest n) \\\\geq \\\\sigma \\\\cdot n$<</equation>>, for all sufficiently large <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. Here, <<equation>>$x \\\\rest n$<</equation>> is the prefix of length <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(\\\\cdot)$<</equation>> is the Kolmogorov complexity. A related notion is that of effective Hausdorff dimension of a sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, defined as: <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(x) = \\\\lim \\\\inf K(x \\\\rest n)/n$<</equation>>. Reiman and Terwijn~\\\\cite{rei:t:thesis} have asked whether for any sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(x) = 1/2$<</equation>> there exists an effective transformation (formally, a Turing reduction) <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(f(x)) > 1/2$<</equation>>. Initially, some partial negative results have been obtained for transformations <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with certain restrictions.  Reimann and Terwijn~\\\\cite[Th 3.10]{rei:t:thesis}   have shown that the answer is NO if we require that <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is a many-one reduction.  This result has been extended by Nies and Reimann~\\\\cite{nie-rei:c:wtt-Kolm-increase} to wtt-reductions.\\nBienvenu, Doty, and Stephan~\\\\cite{bie-dot-ste:c:haussdimension}  have obtained an impossibility result for the general case of Turing reductions, which, however, is valid only for \\\\emph{uniform} transformations. More precisely, building on the result of Nies and Reimann, they have shown that for all constants <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>c<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>c<</symbol>><</symbol>>_2$<</equation>>, with <<equation>>$0 < <<symbol>><<symbol>>c<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1 < <<symbol>><<symbol>>c<</symbol>><</symbol>>_2 < 1$<</equation>>, there is no Turing reduction <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that for any sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(x) \\\\geq c_1$<</equation>>  has the property that <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(f(x)) \\\\geq c_2$<</equation>>. In other words, loosely speaking, no effective uniform transformation is able to raise the randomness rate from <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>c<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1$<</equation>> to <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>c<</symbol>><</symbol>>_2$<</equation>>. Finally, very recently, Miller~\\\\cite{mill:t:KolmExtract} has fully solved the original question, by constructing a sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(x) = 1/2$<</equation>> such that, for any Turing reduction <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(f(x)) \\\\leq 1/2$<</equation>> (or <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> does not exist). \\n\\nOn the other hand, Zimand~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr} has shown that it is possible to increase the randomness rate if the input consists of \\\\emph{two sequences} that enjoy a certain type of \\\\emph{independence}.   \\nNamely, we say that two sequences <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> are finitary-independent\\\\footnote{In~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr}, such sequences are called independent. The paper~\\\\cite{cal-zim:c:dlt08} examines thoroughly the concept of algorithmic independence for sequences and introduces besides finitary-independence, a stronger concept which is called independence. We adopt here the terminology from~\\\\cite{cal-zim:c:dlt08}.}  if for all <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>m<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, \\n<<equation>>\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{e:fin-indep}\\nK(x \\\\rest n ~y \\\\rest m) \\\\geq K(x \\\\rest n) + K(y \\\\rest m) - O(\\\\max (\\\\log n, \\\\log m)).\\n\\\\end{equation}<</equation>>\\nIn~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr}, it is shown that for any constant <<equation>>$0 < <<symbol>>\\\\tau <</symbol>>\\\\leq 1$<</equation>>, there is a Turing reduction <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that, for any finitary-independent sequences <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, both with randomness rate <<equation>>$\\\\geq <<symbol>>\\\\tau<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, it holds that <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>,<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> has randomness rate arbitrarily close to <<equation>>$1$<</equation>> (in particular, <<equation>>$\\\\dimm(f(x,y)) = 1$<</equation>>). Moreover <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is a truth-table reduction and also <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is uniform in <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau<</symbol>>$<</equation>>.\\n\\nTo summarize, if we start with one source, it is impossible to effectively increase the randomness rate, while if we start with two finitary-independent sequences it is possible to increase the randomness rate to close to <<equation>>$1$<</equation>> in a uniform and truth-table manner.\\n\\nIt is clear that the independence requirement plays an important role in the positive result. Since independence can be quantified, it is interesting to see what level of independence is needed for a positive result.\\n\\nFor a function <<equation>>$d: \\\\nat \\\\mapping \\\\real$<</equation>>, we say that strings <<equation>>$<<symbol>>u<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>v<</symbol>>$<</equation>> have dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>> if <<equation>>$<<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>u<</symbol>>) + <<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>v<</symbol>>) - <<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>u<<symbol>><</symbol>>v<</symbol>>)  \\\\leq <<symbol>>d<</symbol>>(\\\\max(<<symbol>>|<<symbol>><</symbol>>u<<symbol>><</symbol>>|<</symbol>>,<<symbol>>|<<symbol>><</symbol>>v<<symbol>><</symbol>>|<</symbol>>))$<</equation>>; we say that two sequences <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> have dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>> if, for every <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>m<</symbol>>$<</equation>> sufficiently large, the strings <<equation>>$x\\\\rest n$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$y \\\\rest m$<</equation>> have dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. With this terminology, sequences <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> are finitary-independent if they have dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>c<</symbol>> \\\\cdot \\\\log <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, for some positive constant <<equation>>$<<symbol>>c<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. \\n\\nThe question becomes: How large can <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>> be so that an effective increase of the randomness rate is possible from two sequences with dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>>?\\nMiller\\'s result shows that this is impossible for dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>) = <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, while the result in~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr} shows that this is possible for dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>) = <<symbol>>c<</symbol>> \\\\cdot \\\\log <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. In fact, \\\\cite{zim:c:csr} shows that, for certain combinations of parameters, an effective increase is possible even for dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>) = <<symbol>><<symbol>>n<</symbol>>^<<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>>, for some <<equation>>$0 < <<symbol>>\\\\alpha <</symbol>>< 1$<</equation>>. More precisely, it is shown that for any <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau <</symbol>>> 0$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\delta <</symbol>>> 0$<</equation>>, there exists <<equation>>$0 < <<symbol>>\\\\alpha <</symbol>>< 1$<</equation>> and a truth-table reduction <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that for any sequences <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> that have randomness rate <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>) = <<symbol>><<symbol>>n<</symbol>>^<<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>>, it holds that <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>,<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> has randomness rate <<equation>>$1 - <<symbol>>\\\\delta<</symbol>>$<</equation>>.\\n\\nIn this paper, we improve the above result and show that one can effectively increase the randomness rate even for two  input sources that have linear dependency. More formally, our result is:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item[(1)] We show that for every <<equation>>$0< <<symbol>>\\\\tau <</symbol>>\\\\leq 1$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\delta <</symbol>>> 0$<</equation>>, there exist <<equation>>$0< <<symbol>>\\\\alpha <</symbol>>< 1$<</equation>> and a truth-table reduction <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that for any sequences <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with randomness rate <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>) = <<symbol>>\\\\alpha  <<symbol>><</symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, the sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>,<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> has randomness rate <<equation>>$\\\\geq (1 - <<symbol>>\\\\delta<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>.\\n\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\n\\nWe also study the finite version of the problem, when the input consists of strings.  Similarly to the infinite case, our interest is in determining how many input strings and what level of dependency are necessary in order to exist an effective procedure that extracts Kolmogorov complexity. Vereshchagin and Vyugin~\\\\cite[Th. 4]{ver-vyu:j:kolm} have shown that one input string is not enough. They construct a string <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> so that any shorter string that has small Kolmogorov complexity conditioned by <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> (in particular any string effectively constructed from <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>>) has small Kolmogorov complexity unconditionally. On the other hand, Fortnow, Hitchcock, Pavan, Vinodchandran and Wang~\\\\cite{fhpvw:c:extractKol} show that an input consisting of several independent strings can accomplish the task, when the number of strings in the input depends on the complexity of the strings. Formally, they show that, for any <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>> there exists a constant <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\ell<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and a polynomial-time procedure\\nthat from an input consisting of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\ell<</symbol>>$<</equation>> <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1, \\\\ldots, <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>\\\\ell<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>>, each with Kolmogorov complexity at least <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma <<symbol>><</symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, constructs\\nan <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit string with Kolmogorov complexity <<equation>>$\\\\succeq <<symbol>>n<</symbol>> - {\\\\rm <<symbol>>d<<symbol>><</symbol>>e<<symbol>><</symbol>>p<</symbol>>}(<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1, \\\\ldots, <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>\\\\ell<</symbol>><</symbol>>)$<</equation>> (<<equation>>${\\\\rm <<symbol>>d<<symbol>><</symbol>>e<<symbol>><</symbol>>p<</symbol>>}(<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1, \\\\ldots, <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>\\\\ell<</symbol>><</symbol>>) = \\\\sum_{<<symbol>><<symbol>>i<</symbol>>=1}^<<symbol>>{\\\\ell}<</symbol>><</symbol>> <<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>) - <<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1 \\\\ldots <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>\\\\ell<</symbol>><</symbol>>)$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$\\\\succeq$<</equation>> means that the inequality holds within an error of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>O<</symbol>>(\\\\log <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>). In view of Vereshchagin-Vyugin result, the question is whether effective extraction of Kolmogorov complexity is possible from two input strings. \\nWe have two results in this regard:\\n\\\\begin{itemize}\\n\\\\item [(2)] We show that if strings <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> of length <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> have dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\alpha <<symbol>><</symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and complexity <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma <<symbol>><</symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, then it is possible to effectively construct a string of length <<equation>>$\\\\approx 2<<symbol>>\\\\sigma <</symbol>>\\\\cdot <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and complexity <<equation>>$\\\\succeq (2<<symbol>>\\\\sigma <</symbol>>- <<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>) \\\\cdot <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, where <<equation>>$\\\\approx$<</equation>> (<<equation>>$\\\\succeq$<</equation>>)  means that the equality (resp., the inequality) is within an error of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>O<</symbol>>(\\\\log <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>. The construction is uniform in <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>,<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>, <<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>, <<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. Note, however, that unlike the procedure from~\\\\cite{fhpvw:c:extractKol}, the construction does not run in polynomial time.\\n\\\\item[(3)] Our second result shows that from strings <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>>,  with sufficiently large complexity and sufficiently small dependency, it is possible to construct a string <<equation>>$<<symbol>>z<</symbol>>$<</equation>> that has large complexity even conditioned by any of the input strings. More precisely if <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> are strings of length <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> that have complexity <<equation>>$<<symbol>>s<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> and dependency <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>, then it is possible to effectively construct a string of length <<equation>>$<<symbol>>m<</symbol>> \\\\approx <<symbol>>s<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)<<symbol>>/<</symbol>>2$<</equation>> such that <<equation>>$<<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>z<</symbol>> \\\\mid <<symbol>>x<</symbol>>) \\\\succeq <<symbol>>m<</symbol>> - <<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> and \\n<<equation>>$<<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>z<</symbol>> \\\\mid <<symbol>>y<</symbol>>) \\\\succeq <<symbol>>m<</symbol>> - <<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>.

This improves a result from~\\\\cite{cal-zim:c:dlt08}, where the input consists of three strings <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1, <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_2, <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>><</symbol>>_3$<</equation>> and the construction produces a string <<equation>>$<<symbol>>z<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with large <<equation>>$<<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>z<</symbol>> \\\\mid <<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>)$<</equation>>, <<equation>>$<<symbol>>i<</symbol>>=1,2,3$<</equation>>.\\n\\\\end{itemize}\\nEffective procedures that extract the Kolmogorov complexity of strings are related to randomness extractors. These are objects of major interest in computational complexity and there is a long and very active line of research dedicated to them. A randomness extractor is a procedure (which, ideally, runs in polynomial time) that improves the quality of a defective source of randomness. A source of randomness is modeled by a distribution <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> on <<equation>>$\\\\zon$<</equation>>, for some <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, and its quality is modeled by the min-entropy of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> (<<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> has min-entropy <<equation>>$<<symbol>>k<</symbol>>$<</equation>> if <<equation>>$2^{-<<symbol>><<symbol>>k<</symbol>><</symbol>>}$<</equation>> is the largest probability that <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> assigns to any string in <<equation>>$\\\\zon$<</equation>>). The distribution <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is defective if its min-entropy is less than <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, and is perfect if its min-entropy is equal to <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, which implies that <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is the uniform distribution on <<equation>>$\\\\zon$<</equation>>. In many applications, it is desirable to transform a defective distribution <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> into a distribution <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>X<</symbol>><</symbol>>\\'$<</equation>> on a set of shorter strings which is close to the uniform distribution. Such a transformation is called a randomness extractor. Randomness extraction is not possible from a single source~\\\\cite{san-vaz:j:quasirand}, but it is possible from two or more sources~\\\\cite{vaz:j:sources}. Consequently, the research has focused on two types of extractors, seeded extractors and multi-source extractors. A seeded extractor extracts randomness from two independent distributions <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>Y<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, where <<equation>>$<<symbol>>X<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is defective and defined on the set of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings  and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>Y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is perfect and defined on the set of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings, with <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>>$<</equation>> much shorter than <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> (typically <<equation>>$<<symbol>>d<</symbol>> = <<symbol>>O<</symbol>>(\\\\log <<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>). A <<equation>>$<<symbol>>k<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-multisource extractor takes as input <<equation>>$<<symbol>>k<</symbol>>$<</equation>> defective distributions on the set of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-bit strings. For <<equation>>$<<symbol>>k<</symbol>>=2$<</equation>>, the best  multisource extractors  are (a) the extractor given by Raz~\\\\cite{raz:c:multiextract} with one source having min-entropy <<equation>>$((1<<symbol>>/<</symbol>>2) + <<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>)<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> (for some small <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>$<</equation>>) and the second source having min-entropy polylog(<<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>), and (b) the extractor given by Bourgain~\\\\cite{bou:j:multiextract} with both sources having min-entropy <<equation>>$((1<<symbol>>/<</symbol>>2) - <<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>)<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>> (for some small <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\alpha<</symbol>>$<</equation>>). There is a clear analogy between randomness extractors and procedures that extract Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, the reader may compare results (2) and (3) discussed above  with existing <<equation>>$2$<</equation>>-multisource extractors, but we emphasize that there is a major difference in that extractors run in polynomial time, while the procedures in (2) and (3) are only in EXPSPACE. On the other hand, results (2) and (3) suggest that it might be possible to construct multisource extractors with sources having a certain level of dependence and/or with the output being random even conditioned by one of the sources.\\n\\nA few words about the proof technique. At the highest level, our method follows the structure of the proofs in~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr}. One key idea is taken from Fortnow et al.~\\\\cite{fhpvw:c:extractKol}, who showed that a multisource extractor also extracts Kolmogorov complexity. Since multisource extractors with the parameters that are needed here are not known to exist, we construct a combinatorial object, called a balanced table, that is similar with a <<equation>>$2$<</equation>>-multisource extractor. A balanced table is a  <<equation>>$2$<</equation>>-dimensional <<equation>>$<<symbol>>N<</symbol>> \\\\times <<symbol>>N<</symbol>>$<</equation>> table with each entry having one of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>M<</symbol>>$<</equation>> colors such that in each sufficiently large subrectangle all the colors appear approximately the same number of times (see Definition~\\\\ref{d:balancedtable}). Using the probabilistic method, we show the existence of balanced tables with appropriate parameters. It follows that such tables can be effectively constructed using exhaustive search. Next, using arguments similiar to those in~\\\\cite{fhpvw:c:extractKol}, we show that if <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> have sufficiently large  complexity and sufficiently small dependence, then the color of the entry in row <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and column <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> of the table has large complexity. These ideas are sufficient to establish result~(2) (Theorem~\\\\ref{t:result2}).  Results (1) (Theorem~\\\\ref{t:sequences}) and (3) (Theorem~\\\\ref{t:result3}) require non-trivial technical refinements of the basic method which are explained in the respective proofs.\\n\\\\section{Preliminaries}\\n\\\\label{s:prelim}\\n\\\\subsection{Notation}\\nWe work over the binary alphabet <<equation>>$\\\\{0,1\\\\}$<</equation>>. A string is an element of <<equation>>$\\\\{0,1\\\\}^*$<</equation>> and a sequence is an element of <<equation>>$\\\\{0,1\\\\}^<<symbol>><<symbol>>{\\\\infty}<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>>. If <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is a string, <<equation>>$<<symbol>>|<<symbol>><</symbol>>x<<symbol>><</symbol>>|<</symbol>>$<</equation>> denotes its length. If <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is a string or a sequence and <<equation>>$n \\\\in \\\\nat$<</equation>>, <<equation>>$x \\\\rest n$<</equation>> denotes the prefix of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> of length <<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. The cardinality of a finite set <<equation>>$<<symbol>>A<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is denoted <<equation>>$<<symbol>>|<<symbol>><</symbol>>A<<symbol>><</symbol>>|<</symbol>>$<</equation>>.

Let <<equation>>$<<symbol>>M<</symbol>>$<</equation>> be a standard Turing machine. For any string <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, define the \\\\emph{(plain) Kolmogorov complexity} of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with respect to <<equation>>$<<symbol>>M<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, as \\n\\\\[K_M(x) = \\\\min \\\\{ |p| \\\\mid M(p) = x \\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\n There is a universal Turing machine <<equation>>$<<symbol>>U<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that for every machine <<equation>>$<<symbol>>M<</symbol>>$<</equation>> there is a constant <<equation>>$<<symbol>>c<</symbol>>$<</equation>> such that for all <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>>,\\n<<equation>>\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{e:univ}\\nK_U(x) \\\\leq K_M(x) + c.\\n\\\\end{equation}<</equation>>\\nWe fix such a universal machine <<equation>>$<<symbol>>U<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and dropping the subscript, we let <<equation>>$<<symbol>>K<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> denote the Kolmogorov complexity of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with respect to <<equation>>$<<symbol>>U<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. For the concept of conditional Komogorov complexity, the underlying machine is a Turing machine that in addition to the read/work tape which in the initial state contains the input <<equation>>$<<symbol>>p<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, has a second tape containing initially a string <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, which is called the conditioning information. Given such a machine <<equation>>$<<symbol>>M<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, we define the Kolmogorov complexity of <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> conditioned by <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>> with respect to <<equation>>$<<symbol>>M<</symbol>>$<</equation>> as \\n\\\\[K_M(x \\\\mid y) = \\\\min \\\\{ |p| \\\\mid M(p, y) = x \\\\}.\\n\\\\]\\nSimilarly to the above, there exist  universal machines of this type and they satisfy the relation similar to Equation~\\\\ref{e:univ}, but for conditional complexity.

In our result,  the Turing reduction is also uniform in two parameters <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\sigma<</symbol>>$<</equation>>. Formally, such a Turing reduction   <<equation>>$<<symbol>>f<</symbol>>$<</equation>> is represented by a two-oracle Turing machine <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>M<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>f<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>>. The machine <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>M<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>f<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> has access to two oracles <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, which are binary sequences. When <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>M<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>f<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> makes the query ``<<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-th bit of first oracle?\" (``<<equation>>$<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>$<</equation>>-th bit of second oracle?\"), the machine obtains <<equation>>$<<symbol>>x<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>> (respectively, <<equation>>$<<symbol>>y<</symbol>>(<<symbol>>n<</symbol>>)$<</equation>>).

The splitting is done in such a way that <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> and <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>y<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> have complexity close to <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau <<symbol>><</symbol>>|<<symbol>><<symbol>><</symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<<symbol>><</symbol>><</symbol>>|<</symbol>>$<</equation>> and respectively close to <<equation>>$<<symbol>>\\\\tau <<symbol>><</symbol>>|<<symbol>><<symbol>><</symbol>>y<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<<symbol>><</symbol>><</symbol>>|<</symbol>>$<</equation>> even conditioned by <<equation>>$\\\\barx_{i-1} \\\\bary_{i-1}$<</equation>>. Next, for each <<equation>>$<<symbol>>i<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, we construct a balanced table <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>T<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> with appropriate parameters and take <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>z<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>> = <<symbol>>T<</symbol>>(<<symbol>><<symbol>>x<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>, <<symbol>><<symbol>>y<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>)$<</equation>>. The output of the truth-table reduction is the sequence <<equation>>$<<symbol>>z<</symbol>> = <<symbol>><<symbol>>z<</symbol>><</symbol>>_1 <<symbol>><<symbol>>z<</symbol>><</symbol>>_2 \\\\ldots <<symbol>><<symbol>>z<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>> \\\\ldots$<</equation>>. As in the case of strings, it follows that <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>z<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> has high complexity and actually this holds even conditioned by <<equation>>$\\\\barz_{i-1} = z_1 z_2 \\\\ldots z_{i-1}$<</equation>>. So far, the proof is as in~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr}. The point of departure is that in order for the construction to work with inputs having linear dependence, we need to take the length of <<equation>>$<<symbol>><<symbol>>z<</symbol>>_<<symbol>>i<</symbol>><</symbol>>$<</equation>> exponential in <<equation>>$<<symbol>>i<</symbol>>$<</equation>> (rather than quadratic in <<equation>>$<<symbol>>i<</symbol>>$<</equation>>, which was the case in~\\\\cite{zim:c:csr}).
